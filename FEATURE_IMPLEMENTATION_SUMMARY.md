# Event Creation Improvements - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Image Upload to Supabase Storage

**What was changed:**
- Replaced URL input field with file upload functionality
- Added image preview with remove option
- Integrated with Supabase Storage for secure image hosting
- Added comprehensive file validation (type, size)

**Technical details:**
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Supported formats: JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- Images stored in `images/event-images/` bucket structure
- Unique filenames prevent conflicts: `[timestamp]-[randomId].[extension]`
- Public read access for displaying images
- Authenticated upload restrictions for security

**Files modified:**
- `src/components/events/CreateEventModal.tsx` - Main implementation
- `database/storage-setup.sql` - Storage bucket configuration

### 2. ✅ Improved Time Selection (15-minute intervals)

**What was changed:**
- Replaced free-form time input with dropdown selection
- Generated options in 15-minute intervals (00:00, 00:15, 00:30, 00:45)
- Display format: 12-hour with AM/PM for better UX
- Storage format: 24-hour (HH:MM) for consistency

**Technical details:**
- 96 total time options (24 hours × 4 intervals)
- Automatic format conversion for display vs storage
- User-friendly dropdown interface
- No more manual time typing errors

**User experience:**
- **Before:** `type="time"` input (browser-dependent, sometimes confusing)
- **After:** Clear dropdown with "9:00 AM", "9:15 AM", "9:30 AM", etc.

### 3. ✅ Title Length Restriction (30 characters)

**What was changed:**
- Added 30-character limit to event titles
- Real-time character counter display
- Visual feedback when approaching limit
- Form validation prevents submission of over-limit titles

**Technical details:**
- Character counter: `{current}/30`
- Counter turns red at 25+ characters (warning)
- `maxLength` attribute prevents typing beyond limit
- Server-side validation as backup

**User experience:**
- Clear visual feedback on character usage
- Prevents overly long titles that break UI layout
- Encourages concise, readable event titles

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Supabase Storage Setup

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create storage bucket for images
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('images', 'images', true);

-- Set up access policies
CREATE POLICY "Public read access on images bucket" ON storage.objects
  FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'images');

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload images" ON storage.objects
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
    bucket_id = 'images' 
    AND auth.role() = 'authenticated'
  );
```

### 2. Verify Implementation

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
3. Test event creation with:
   - Long title (see character counter)
   - Image upload (drag & drop or click)
   - Time selection (dropdown with 15-min intervals)
